#+TITLE: Scripts

This is a collection of some scripts written by myself and (mostly) used by myself. Linus Torvalds once said that he likes to write tools for himself, and I was intrigured by this kind of programming workflow, try to, and enjoy to make some tools for myself.
And that's the reason why I prefer to work at CLI than GUI, making things for your own is way much easier without GUI.
